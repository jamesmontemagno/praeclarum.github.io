The [speaker list for Lang.NEXT 2012](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012) has been released, and I found myself trying to decide which speakers to go see. There are a lot of fine choices so I thought I had better get organized!

Here are the speakers I want to see because of a "personal" connections:

* [Andrei Alexandescu](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Andrei-Alexandrescu) was my C++ hero for years as I dove deeper and deeper into the language and metaprogramming.
* [Martin Odersky](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Martin-Odersky) created Scala and I loved Scala for a time.
* [Herb Sutter](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Herb-Sutter) because I've read all his books and in doing so fooled myself into thinking C++ was a valid language. :-) Honestly, I really don't care what other ridiculous features have been bolted onto C this year, but it would be fun to see him present.

And then there are those I want to see because of their notoriety:

* [Gilad Bracha](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Gilad-Bracha) because he just seems ridiculously smart and continues to invent new and interesting languages.
* [Erik Meijer](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Erik-Meijer) because he is energetic and usually has something interesting to say.
* [Mads Torgersen](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Mads-Torgersen) for his C#ness. But really, do I need more C# knowledge. ;-)

Then there are the speakers I want to see because they sound fascinating:

* [Andrew Black](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/speakers/Andrew-Black) says he understands OOP and mobile. I want to see if his ideas of OOP jive with my own.
* [Walter Bright](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Walter-Bright) seems to be a big compiler geek. Compilers are boring, but compiler geeks are not.
* [Kim Bruce](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Kim-Bruce) he said OOP and Java in the same sentence, but I'll forgive him for that since he sounds like a sincere smart one.
* [William Cook](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/William-Cook) worked on AppleScript and more OOP.
* [Jeroen Frijters](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Jeroen-Frijters) because kangaroo vouched for him and IKVM is cool.
* [Andy Gordon](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Andy-Gordon) because his bio mentions machine learning and F#. Check, and check.
* [Robert Griesemer](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Robert-Griesemer) made Go and worked on the V8 engine. There must be some good stuff to learn from him.
