<p>The <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012">speaker list for Lang.NEXT 2012</a> has been released, and I found myself trying to decide which speakers to go see. There are a lot of fine choices so I thought I had better get organized!</p>


<p>Here are the speakers I want to see because of a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; connections:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Andrei-Alexandrescu">Andrei Alexandescu</a> was my C++ hero for years as I dove deeper and deeper into the language and metaprogramming.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Martin-Odersky">Martin Odersky</a> created Scala and I loved Scala for a time.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Herb-Sutter">Herb Sutter</a> because I&rsquo;ve read all his books and in doing so fooled myself into thinking C++ was a valid language. :-) Honestly, I really don&rsquo;t care what other ridiculous features have been bolted onto C this year, but it would be fun to see him present.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there are those I want to see because of their notoriety:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Gilad-Bracha">Gilad Bracha</a> because he just seems ridiculously smart and continues to invent new and interesting languages.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Erik-Meijer">Erik Meijer</a> because he is energetic and usually has something interesting to say.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Mads-Torgersen">Mads Torgersen</a> for his C#ness. But really, do I need more C# knowledge. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are the speakers I want to see because they sound fascinating:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/speakers/Andrew-Black">Andrew Black</a> says he understands OOP and mobile. I want to see if his ideas of OOP jive with my own.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Walter-Bright">Walter Bright</a> seems to be a big compiler geek. Compilers are boring, but compiler geeks are not.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Kim-Bruce">Kim Bruce</a> he said OOP and Java in the same sentence, but I&rsquo;ll forgive him for that since he sounds like a sincere smart one.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/William-Cook">William Cook</a> worked on AppleScript and more OOP.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Jeroen-Frijters">Jeroen Frijters</a> because kangaroo vouched for him and IKVM is cool.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Andy-Gordon">Andy Gordon</a> because his bio mentions machine learning and F#. Check, and check.</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Robert-Griesemer">Robert Griesemer</a> made Go and worked on the V8 engine. There must be some good stuff to learn from him.</li>
</ul>
