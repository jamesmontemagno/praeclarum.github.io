<p>Here is the abstract of a talk I hope to give at <a href="http://monkeyspace.org" title="MonkeySpace 2013">MonkeySpace</a> in July - submitted a mere one week after the deadline. Let&rsquo;s hope the organizers like the idea!</p>


<p><strong>Asynchronous Application Patterns in C#</strong></p>


<p>Now that Mono 3.0 supports the await keyword in C# we finally have an excuse to go back and rewrite all our networking code. Wait, no, nevermind, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>


<p>Instead, let&rsquo;s explore ways to write new code that takes advantage of this new syntax. We will look at common mobile app user experiences and see how we can use await and async code to create them. And maybe, just maybe, we&rsquo;ll write some networking code along the way.</p>


<p>After we&rsquo;re all bored with the practical uses of await, let&rsquo;s take a quick glance at some more advanced - exotic - ridiculus? - uses of the syntax to enable new experiences.</p>
