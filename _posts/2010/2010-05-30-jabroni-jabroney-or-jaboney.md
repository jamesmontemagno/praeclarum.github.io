**Long story short:** *Jabroni* is the modern form of *Jaboney*, American slang used to mock someone, somewhat vaguely, since at least 1931. The [online etymology dictionary](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jabroni) defines a jaboney as a "naive person, immigrant, hoodlum."

**The Long Story**

Recently on [No Agenda](http://noagendashow.com), [Adam Curry](http://curry.com/) was wondering about the etymology of "Jabroni". Since I've heard the word all my life, I was dismayed that the internet credits it to [The Rock](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Jabroni&defid=1184851)... almost everywhere.

I started my search with the [Goog](http://google.com) of course, Goog Books to be exact. I was looking for [a reference prior to 1990](http://books.google.com/books?lr=&as_brr=0&q=jabroni&btnG=Search+Books&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=1000&as_maxm_is=1&as_maxy_is=1990), that is, prior to The Rock. Some matches were found, but most of those matches seemed to be the Goog book OCR system incorrectly matching *Fabroni*.

And then I got lucky and ran into this internet question: [Jaboney or Jabroney](http://www.lemmingtrail.com/mb/199730/). The consensus on the form was to use the spelling with an "r", but I was intrigued enough to try Goog Books again. I searched for [Jaboney prior to 1990](http://books.google.com/books?lr=&as_brr=0&q=jaboney&btnG=Search+Books&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=1000&as_maxm_is=1&as_maxy_is=1990) and hit the jackpot.

The first hit that caught my eye was **[A-18: a novel](http://books.google.com/books?id=wOdaAAAAIAAJ&q=jaboney&dq=jaboney&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=1000&as_maxm_is=1&as_maxy_is=1990&as_brr=0&cd=5)**[ by Thomas Taylor written in 1967](http://books.google.com/books?id=wOdaAAAAIAAJ&q=jaboney&dq=jaboney&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=1000&as_maxm_is=1&as_maxy_is=1990&as_brr=0&cd=5). In the book, he uses the word just as we would today:

> "She got the jaboney to marry her, so I didn't have to support her too long."


(There is a second use, but Goog cut it off.)

In addition to the reference in this novel, [American Speech vol. 6 from 1931](http://books.google.com/books?id=7dk4AAAAMAAJ&dq=jaboney&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=1000&as_maxm_is=1&as_maxy_is=1990&as_brr=0&cd=9) lists the word but unfortunately there is no scan of the page available. Now I'm off to the [Seattle Library](http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/1480854?page=frame&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcatalog.spl.org%2Fipac20%2Fipac.jsp%3Findex%3DISBNEX%26term%3D0003-1283%26checksum%3D245c8ffee7a9bb3925601f389f433633&title=Seattle+Public+Library&linktype=opac&detail=UOK%3ASeattle+Public+Library%3APublic+Library) to see if I can find it.

There are further references in 1934, 1949, 1953, 1969, 1987, 1989, and more.

So it's pretty certain that those WWE wrestlers didn't make this one up.
