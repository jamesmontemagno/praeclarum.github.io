When you advance as a programmer you inevitably learn a variety of languages. You will always have a few favorites that you prefer to use but you will become comfortable (out of necessity) with others.

This leads many professional programmers to come to the conclusion that programming languages don’t matter. I can write bubble sort in JavaScript just as well as I can write it in Lisp so what’s is the difference? Things only worsen when you pull out Turing. Turing said all computing machines (at least the variety we’re making today) are all equally capable of solving the same problems. We like to extrapolate this interesting proof into real world meaning: programming languages don’t matter. When we professionals need to teach non-professionals, we do not bring our own baggage with us. Just because I prefer to write production apps in C# does not mean I am going to force that language on newcomers. It really doesn’t matter what they will learn because (A) most programming concepts are universal, (B) they will end up learning other languages eventually, and, oh yeah, © programming languages don’t matter.

Except they do.
